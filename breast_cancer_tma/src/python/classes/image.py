    """
    An image composed of an array of doubles plus secondary attributes
    The secondary attributes include:

    spot_name - numbered spot name corresponding to its location in
                the tissue microarray (e.g. '001')

    cohort_num - number corresponding to its cancer subtype
                classification or cancer cell line:
                1: ER+ IDC
                2: ER+ ILC
                3: ER- IDC
                4: HER2+ IDC
                5: MCF7
                6: MCF10A
                7: MDA-MB-231
                8: MDA-MB-468

    xy - an array containing the spatial (xy) coordinates for each
         cell measured from the top-left corner

    tilesize - height and width (in pixels) of the child patches
               derived from image

    threshold - number of cells required for child patches to be
                considered informative, and thus retained

    parent_image - for derived images, the the parent that was used
                   to create this image. This image may inherit
                   attributes from the parent image, such as
                   spot_name, cohort_num etc.

    patches - child images of size tilesize x tilesize derived by
              splitting this image into patches

    path_name - the path name to the file holding the image

    file_name - the file name of the file holding the image

    patches_outdir - path name to the directory contain child patches
