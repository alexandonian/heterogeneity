Notes:
DATA_FETCHER CLASS
loads all the data associated with some spatial region of interest (i.e. plane of  tissue image)
need to know the image type (e.g. WSI, and desired features e.g. cellular locations, image if possible )

IMAGE-represents all the spatial information associated with some tissue/region of interest (i.e. the plane of imaged tissue)
if possible 
- in the future, I can imagine a 3D image or "voxel like structure" contains properties of a 3D section of tissue that has been assembled by stacking many aligned images 

spatial statisics class
    send images through conv net
